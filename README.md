# EnceptaAssignmentDemoPart2

Implement a class that uses generics (to support any data type) and acts as a service for caching data by a string key, is limited to an arbitrary number of entries (e.g. 1000), has no time expiration, and uses a LRU (least recently used) algorithm for the eviction policy. Keep a balance of both performance and simplicity in mind when implementing it. Feel free to use a library or package for specific helper functions where appropriate.
